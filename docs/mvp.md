# MVP Implementation Roadmap

## Core Goal
Create a visualization tool that maps backend architecture relationships by analyzing API endpoints and their component dependencies.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: API Route Analysis
- Detect API entry points and route handlers
- Map HTTP methods and endpoints
- Create base graph structure with API routes

### Phase 2: Service Layer Mapping
- Track service class instantiations in route handlers
- Identify method calls on service instances
- Map dependencies between endpoints and services

### Phase 3: Component Relationships
- Analyze service-to-service interactions
- Map class inheritance hierarchies
- Track utility function usage

### Phase 4: Visualization
- Generate interactive graph visualization
- Implement collapsible component views
- Add relationship type indicators

## Success Criteria
- Can analyze multiple backend frameworks:
  - Python: FastAPI/Flask
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: Express/NestJS
- Shows endpoint → service → dependency flow
- Generates navigable graph visualization

## Out of Scope
- Frontend components
- Database schema analysis
- Configuration parsing
- Variable tracking
- Utility functions not directly used by services
